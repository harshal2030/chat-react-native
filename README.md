# TARDIS

## Inspiration

Has it ever happened that you are texting with someone and you have to wait very long for their texts? Or that they type for like 15 min just to send a "Okay". If you also have anxiety issues like us, then you probably know the feel of waiting for someone's text is the worst feel in the world.

We wanted to design a solution that would allow us to view texts as they are being typed and that's exactly what we did!

## What it does

Meet Tardis, a truly real-time texting app that let's you see the message even before it's sent. Now you no longer have to get anxious over what someone would say or how they would react because you can read their texts as they are typing them.

No more backspacing those emotions! A texting app so good that it would blur the lines between texting and calling.


The App was designed in **Figma** , created in **React-Native** leveraging **Firebase's** Realtime Database.

## Let's see a quick Demo.

### Both people Enter their names and Join a room. After that, as One person types, the other can see their messages as they are being typed releaving them of all anxiety, make the chats more fun and increasing the speed of conversation by reducing waiting time. 
### Those extra seconds you gain and the fun you have, that's waht makes this project Tardis!
